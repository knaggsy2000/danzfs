# DanZFS

DanZFS is aiming to provide a standard Python backend to ZFS without using libzfs - we call the system executables.

Only requires a base install of Python to function.

Project was created to aid me in administrating and monitoring ZFS file servers via Python - thought it would be useful for others as well.

Currently the code only provides lists, statuses, and also provides two applications which gives the ability to clean snapshots and also provide near realtime replication of data (something which ZFS really could do with, all the tools are there).



Status: Alpha

Supported OS: FreeBSD

Needs Testing: Linux, and Solaris
